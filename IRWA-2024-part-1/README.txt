The objective of this project is to develop a search engine.
Our first part of this project is structured in the following way: 

- Part 0: Imports and Drive. 
- Part 1: Text Preprocessing 
	1.1 Data Load
	1.2 Text preprocessing functions
	1.3 Tweet Example
- Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
	2.1 Basic statistics
	2.2 Word cloud of topN words
	2.3 Retweeted tweets
	2.4 Entity Recognition
	2.5 Other interesting Statistics
		2.5.1 Most common hashtags
		2.5.2 Most retweeted users
		2.3.3 Tweets time evolution

In Part 0, we import all the necessary libraries and connect to Google Drive. 
In Part 1, we preprocess the tweets, following the guidelines in the project statement. 
Finally, in Part 2, we perform an analysis of the data to better understand its characteristics.


To run the code you will need to CHANGE THE ZIP PATH OF THE DATASET FILE!!!



Next, we will explain the most important things: 

- It's mandatory to run the code in order from part 0 until part 2. There are parts of the code that reuse previous functions, so they may not function if you don't follow the order.

- Part 0 imports all the necessary libraries. If you don't have one installed you may need to do a pip install.

- Part 1 is divided into three subparts. The first one loads the data DIRECTLY FROM THE ZIP. The second one uses functions to preprocess the tweets, and the third is an example of the tweet after being preprocessed. 

- Part 2 is also divided into 5 subparts. The first one includes the basic statistics: topN words, Word distribution and average sentence length. The second one includes a wordcloud of the topN words. The third one shows the most retweeted tweets. The fourth one makes an entity recognition. Finally, the last one includes other statistics we have found interesting. 

- Inside 2.5, you will find the most common hashtags, the most common hashtags coocurrences, the most retweeted users, and the evolution of the tweets over time.
