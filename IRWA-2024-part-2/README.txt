The objective of this project is to develop a search engine. In this second part, we continue analyzing and enriching the data processed in the first part.

Project Structure

- Part 0: Imports and Drive setup
- Part 1: Text Preprocessing (only section 1.1 is required to run this part)
  - 1.1 Data Load
- Part 2: Further Data Analysis
  - 2.1 Additional Analysis Functions
  - 2.2 Statistical Insights
  - 2.3 Data Visualization

Important Notes

- Execution Order: To execute this part, you must first run Part 1.1 to load and preprocess the data. Part 1.2 is not required for this section.
- Library Imports: Part 0 includes all necessary library imports. Ensure all required libraries are installed; use pip install if needed.
  
Detailed Explanation

- Part 0 initializes the libraries and connects to Google Drive.
  
- Part 1.1 loads the data directly from a specified ZIP path. Note: Ensure the dataset file path is updated accordingly.
  
- Part 2 expands on the analysis performed in Part 1, introducing new functions to extract deeper insights from the data and visualize key findings.
