## Important Notes

- **Execution Order**: To execute this part, ensure Part 1 and Part 2 are completed as they prepare the data and indexing structures required for this section.
- **Library Imports**: Part 0 includes all necessary library imports. Ensure all required libraries are installed by running `pip install` as needed.
  
## Detailed Explanation

- **Part 0** initializes the libraries and establishes a Google Drive connection.
  
- **Part 1.1** and **Part 1.2** load and analyze the dataset, preparing it for advanced processing. Ensure the data path is set correctly if these steps are required.

- **Part 3.1** enhances the query functionality with new methods to expand and interpret queries using synonym matching and fuzzy logic, enabling better handling of varied query inputs.

- **Part 3.2** introduces result diversification techniques such as clustering, aiming to present results from varied topics or sources for broader relevance.

- **Part 3.3** focuses on optimizing the search engine's performance by reducing memory consumption and improving query execution time through targeted optimizations.
